These files are from COSC342, but may be of interest to COSC326 students for
the Rational Thinking etude. They are two labs for COSC342. 

The first deals with classes for Matrices and Vectors, which provide additional 
examples of operator overloading. That lab also discusses the CMake build system 
which you may find useful. The files for this part are:
- MatrixMaths.pdf - the description of the lab exercises
- lab02_Code - contains source code for the lab

The second looks at some aspects of C++ in more detail, particularly the object
model, resource management, and the object life-cycle. While you won't need all 
the material in this lab (inheritance is not required in the etude, for example),
it may be helpful in understanding C++ more generally. The files for this lab are:
- cppEssentials.pdf - the description of the lab exercises
- cppObjects - contains source code for the first part of the lab 
- Shapes - contains source code for the second part of the lab
